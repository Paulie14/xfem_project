002:


- MY OWN ERROR in L2 NORM - done
- collect numeric parameters at some place, or at least set them there (N adaptive refinements, tolerances etc..) - moved to Model_base
- XFEM with only ramp function - template adaptive integration for xfem with ramp only - done
- flags for output features - done
- rename convergence table according to test name - done
- actualize FEM model (some virtual methods added etc..) - done
- sources in FEM - done

- rename members in Square and AdaptiveIntegration (make common quadrature, not gauss)
- use ini input file and read by ParameterHandler
- gnuplot script to print the convergence graph 
(collect the data in one file from different runs, then call script and print all)
- clean output methods

- convergence rate SGFEM, XFEM, FEM on simple model and with sin(x)
- study scaled condition number - SGFEM is not better

- check the behaviour with more wells / more wells in one element
- what about that BEM model? 

- automatic enrichment radius choice
- think of precomputed quadrature points for adaptive interpolation and mapping them onto cells

BUGs:
- pdf print in adaptive refinement script - "set terminal pdf; set output "out.pdf"; replot;" provides broken pdf
(to ps and then call from unix ps2pdf works, but without colors)
